<p>My name is Raul Galindo and I am a software developer from Venezuela, currently working in Barcelona, Spain.</p>

<p>I hold a high standard of quality and style in everything that I do and I try to learn something new every day.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Write highly-scalable, modular and self-explaining code</p>

<p>Qustodian is an app that delivers offers and ads based on user interests and preferences. It is a big app with background jobs, talks to several Apis and serves an Api itself.</p>

<p>Due to scalating problems, we, a team of 3 developers, redesigned the whole app. It started as a conventional Rails stack and then it was extended by implementing service objects, form objects, serializers, decorators, and other patterns. This allowed us to maintain our goal of having the cleanest, most scalable code possible, writing lots of small classes with clear responsibilities. There is also a good chunk of JavaScript on the frontend, written in CoffeeScript. The app has a great test coverage using Rspec and Jasmine.</p>
