Who I am
--------

My name is Raul Galindo and I am a software developer from Venezuela, currently working in Barcelona, Spain.

I hold a high standard of quality and style in everything that I do and I try to learn something new every day.

My goal is producing work that I can be proud of 

What I can do
-------------

* Design, build and deploy software using the right tools

* Write highly-scalable, modular and self-explaining code

* Pixel perfect, clean-coded, valid, and cross-browser websites

* Write truly responsive 'mobile first' HTML/CSS

I mostly use ruby and a SQL server to build backends and JavaScript/CoffeeScript to build frontends, although I also know other popular languages. 


What I have done
----------------

**Qustodian, <http://www.qustodian.com>**  
*2012-2014*  
*Full Stack Developer*

Qustodian is an app that delivers offers and ads based on user interests and preferences. It is a big app with background jobs, talks to several Apis and serves an Api itself.

Due to scalating problems, we, a team of 3 developers, redesigned the whole app. It started as a conventional Rails stack and then it was extended by implementing service objects, form objects, serializers, decorators, and other patterns. This allowed us to maintain our goal of having the cleanest, most scalable code possible, writing lots of small classes with clear responsibilities. There is also a good chunk of JavaScript on the frontend, written in CoffeeScript. The app has a great test coverage using Rspec and Jasmine.

I am also responsible for the frontend of the mobile web, using HTML5/CSS3 & jQuery. See it live at <http://m.qustodian.com>


**TheGoodData, <http://www.thegooddata.org>**  
*2014*  
*Frontend Developer*

TheGoodData is a cooperative that allows its users to obtain control of their data. I focused on the development of the Chrome extension using plain JavaScript and Html/CSS, and also did some of the website's frontend.

**Parkside, <http://www.parkside.at>**  
*2011-2012*  
*Frontend Developer*  

I worked on the [Video2brain](http://www.video2brain.com) team, an international video training website with 400k+ users. My job there was implementing new features (mostly JavaScript) and typical layout tasks.

**Gruebl Automatisierungstechnik**  
*2010-2011*  
*Full Stack Developer*
 
KVZ – standard Ruby on Rails app that gathered Project information, contacts and other information to help the workers to find accomodations, food and other services in eastern Europe. Mysql database and extensive use of jQuery datatables (datatables.net)

PIM – also a RoR app to manage the problems and incidences of the support department. Due to a highly rotating staff, this was very important to centralize the know-how of the company. This app integrated with the KVZ App.

In both projects I was responsible for a variety of tasks including front and backend development, user experience design, visual design, and server setup and maintenance.

**Universidad Central de Venezuela**  
*[Facultad de Ciencias](http://www.ciens.ucv.ve/ciens/)*
