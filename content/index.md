Who I am
--------

My name is Raul Galindo and I am a Software Engineering Leader with more than 15 years of experience developing software professionally, mostly with Ruby and Javascript.

I hold a high standard of quality and style in everything that I do. I'm constantly working on improving my skills and workflow to become more productive as a manager, and as a team member.

My goal is to help companies succeed building quality products that impact and empower people using them.

What I can do
-------------

* Support, coach and develop high-performing engineers.

* Lead distributed Engineering teams and ensure they performing and delivering quality solutions.

* Plan and execute software projects from inception through implementation.

* Design, build and deploy software using proper tools.

* Represent the nature of engineering work and facilitate comunication with other stakeholders.


I mostly use ruby and a SQL server to build backends and JavaScript to build frontends. I also know other popular languages.

**Intellum, <http://www.intellum.com>{:target="_blank"}**<br>
*2022-Current*<br>
*Engineering Manager - Remote*

As an Engineering manager, my main responsibilies are ensuring our teams are staffed, performing and delivering quality solutions, while supporting the wellbeing and ongoing professional development of their members.

I have been able to understand and represent the nature of my team's work, communicate the challenges and complexities to other stakeholders, and help to ensure the teams are making good decisions about where to spend their time and effort.

Altough I no longer contribute to my team's goals by writing code or designing systems, I always search for outlets where I can perform some coding and general hands-on engineering. I also contribute technically in other ways, for example, writing and commenting on pitches, participating in breakdown and estimation sessions, interviewing and onboarding new engineers, and managing incidents.
