Who am i
--------

My name is Raul Galindo, I am a software developer from Venezuela, currently working in Barcelona, Spain.

I hold a high standard of quality and style in everything that I do. 
My motivation is producing work that I can be proud of and I try to learn something new everyday.

What can I do
-------------

* Design, build and deploy software using the right tools

* Write highly-scalable, modular and self-explaining code

* Pixel perfect, clean-coded, valid, and cross-browser websites

* Write truly responsive 'mobile first' HTML/CSS

I mostly use ruby and a SQL server to build backends and JavaScript/CoffeeScript to build frontends, altought i also know other popular languages. 


What have I done
----------------

**Qustodian, <http://www.qustodian.com>**  
*2012-2014*  
*Full Stack Developer*

Qustodian is an app that delivers offers and ads based on user interests and preferences. Its a big app with background jobs, talks to several Apis and serves an Api itself.

Due to scalating problems, we, a team of 3 developers redesigned the whole app, started from a conventional Rails stack and then extended it using service objects, form objects, serializers, decorators and other patterns, allowing us to maintain our goal of having the cleanest, more scalable code possible, writing lots of small classes with clear responsabilities. There is also a good chunk of javascript on the frontend, written in CoffeeScript. The app has a great test coverage using Rspec and Jasmine.

I also am responsible for the frontend of the mobile web, using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. See it live at <http://m.qustodian.com>


**TheGoodData, <http://www.thegooddata.org>**  
*2014*  
*Frontend Developer*

TheGoodData is a cooperative that allows its users to obtain control of their data. I focused on the development of the Chrome extension using plain JavaScript and Html/CSS, and also took part on the website's frontend.

**Parkside, <http://www.parkside.at>**  
*2011-2012*
