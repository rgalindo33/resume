What have I done
----------------

**Qustodian, <http://www.qustodian.com>**  
*2012-2014*  
*Full Stack Developer*

Qustodian is an app that delivers offers and ads based on user interests and preferences. It has several open fronts, talking to several Apis and serving an Api itself. As result of a business expansion, it became a service which 3rd party apps could integrate to their own application.

In order to achieve this, the app had to be completely rewritten. The app was redesigned, starting from a conventional Rails stack and then extending it using service objects, form objects, serializers, decorators and other patterns, allowing us to maintain our goal of having a clean codesmall classes with clear responsabilities. There is also a good chunk of javascript on the frontend, written in CoffeeScript. The app has a great test coverage using Rspec and Jasmine.

I also am responsible for the frontend of the mobile web, using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. See it live at <http://m.qustodian.com>
