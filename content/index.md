Who I am
--------

My name is Raul Galindo and I am a passionate software developer specialized in OOP, Web, Ruby, JavaScript and swift.

I hold a high standard of quality and style in everything that I do. I'm constantly working on improving my skills and workflow to become more productive as a programmer and as a team member.

My goal is to help companies succeed building quality products that impact and empower people using them.

What I can do
-------------

* Design, build and deploy software using proper tools

* Write highly-scalable, modular and self-explaining code

* Design APIs focused on functionality, usability and developer experience

* Pixel perfect, clean-coded, valid, and cross-browser websites

* Plan and execute software projects from inception through implementation

I mostly use ruby and a SQL server to build backends and JavaScript to build frontends. I also know other popular languages.
