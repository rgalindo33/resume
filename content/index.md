Who I am
--------

My name is Raul Galindo and I am a developer from Venezuela, specialized in OOP, Web, Ruby, and JavaScript.

I am a passionate software writter and hold a high standard of quality and style in everything that I do.
 
I wish to build web apps that impact and empower the people using them. My goal is producing work that I can be proud of.

What I can do
-------------

* Design, build and deploy software using the right tools

* Write highly-scalable, modular and self-explaining code

* Pixel perfect, clean-coded, valid, and cross-browser websites

* Write truly responsive 'mobile first' HTML/CSS

I mostly use ruby and a SQL server to build backends and JavaScript/CoffeeScript to build frontends, although I also know other popular languages.

**Qustodian, <http://www.qustodian.com>{:target="_blank"}**  
*2012-2014*  
*Full Stack Developer*

I am currently working for Qustodian, an app that delivers highly segmentated messages based on user interests, geolocation and preferences. 

It is a Rails stack extended by several PORO's: service objects to handle business logic, form objects for data modeling and maping, serializers to format the models data being sent to others APIs' and decorators to handle the presentation logic.

The app is written in a clean fashion way, following SOLID principles and has a great test coverage using Rspec and Jasmine. 

There is also a good chunk of JavaScript on the frontend, written in DRY modular CoffeeScript.

I am also responsible for the frontend of the mobile web, using HTML5/CSS3 & jQuery. See it live at <http://m.qustodian.com>{:target="_blank"}
