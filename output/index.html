<em>2012-2014</em><br />
<em>Full Stack Developer</em></p>

<p>Qustodian is an app that delivers offers and ads based on user interests and preferences. Its a big app with background jobs, talks to several Apis and serves an Api itself.</p>

<p>Due to scalating problems, we, a team of 3 developers redesigned the whole app, started from a conventional Rails stack and then extended it using service objects, form objects, serializers, decorators and other patterns, allowing us to maintain our goal of having the cleanest, more scalable code possible, writing lots of small classes with clear responsabilities. There is also a good chunk of javascript on the frontend, written in CoffeeScript. The app has a great test coverage using Rspec and Jasmine.</p>

<p>I also am responsible for the frontend of the mobile web, using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery. See it live at <a href="http://m.qustodian.com">http://m.qustodian.com</a></p>
